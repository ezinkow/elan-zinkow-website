            I'm Elan. I live in the Uptown neighborhood in Chicago, IL with my wife and our two young boys. I have a
            strong background in professional sports production where I worked for 8 years. Please check out my <a

            coding bootcamp student through Northwestern University. Following completion of this intense program in
            March, I plan on launching a new career as a software developer.
